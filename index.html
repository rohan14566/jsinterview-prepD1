    <h4>Q.1 Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h4>
   the == is used for comparison between two variables irrespective of the datatype of variable.<br> whereas the === operator compares the values as well as the data types of the operands.<br>Example:
    <h4>What is the spread operator?</h4>
    The spread operator ... is used to expand or spread an iterable or an array.<br>
    You can also use the spread syntax ... to copy the items into a single array<br>
    quickly copy all or part of an existing array into another array.
    <h4>What are the differences between var, let and const?</h4>
    var-: (1)var variable is functional scope.(2).it can be updated and re-declared into the scope.(3).it can be declared without initialization <br>
    let-: (1)let variable is block scope.(2).it can be updated and can't be re-declared into the scope.(3).it can be declared without initialization<br>
    const-:(1)const variable is block scope.(2).it can't be updated or can't be re-declared into the scope.(3).it can't be declared without initialization
    <h4>What is execution context</h4>
    Execution context (EC) is defined as the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed<br>
    The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that help in its execution.<br>
    The execution context is a place where your javascript code is actually executed and the call stack is the collection of your execution context which works in the Last in First out manner.
    <h4>What is meant by first class functions</h4>
    First-class functions are JavaScript functions that can behave like variables.<br> They can also be parsed as arguments to higher-order functions.
    <h4>What are closures? Give an example of closure</h4>
    closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.<br> In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
    <h4>Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h4>
    call()-: Call invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.<br> Apply()-:Apply invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.<br>bind() -: Bind returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
